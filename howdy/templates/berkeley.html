<b><font size='6'>Ecology Center</font></b></ul>
<ul>  (Ages 14-22)<br>
  The Ecology Center’s Youth Environmental Academy (YEA) is a green leadership development program for young people ages 14-22. YEA provides structured, paid internships to youth at our headquarters in West Berkeley.
Through programming based on the nationally acclaimed Roots of Success curriculum, youth will emerge with content knowledge across the following areas:<br>
1) Health, Food Systems, Food Justice, and Sustainable Agriculture, <br>
2) Alternative Energy, <br>
3) Climate Change, <br>
4) Water Conservation, and<br>
 5) Waste Management and Recycling.<br>
Through guided, hands-on projects led by professionals, youth will also gain job skills that will prepare them for green careers. YEA participants “earn and learn” while moving to positions of greater responsibility and leadership – from Youth Scholars to Youth Interns to Youth Program Assistants. The ultimate outcome is a new generation of environmentally conscious community leaders!
