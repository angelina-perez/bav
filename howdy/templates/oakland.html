  Volunteers at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland are a diverse, well trained group of individuals who generously give thousands of hours each year to support hospital staff and patients. Our Volunteer program is service-based, which means that our volunteers provide service to the hospital without the expectation of personal benefit beyond the intangible benefits of service.

<li>Commit to a minimum of one shift per week for at least six months of continuous service, and a total minimum commitment of 100 hours</li>
