The Teen Leadership Academy is designed to provide our young adults opportunities to gain real life and work experience through civic engagement.

Please discuss the programs with your school’s volunteer service coordinator for final approval. Students will receive 20-35 service hours per week!
There are optional open house and mandatory orientations.
The two programs available under the Teen Leadership Academy are Counselor in Training (CIT) and the Youth Service Corps (YSC).
